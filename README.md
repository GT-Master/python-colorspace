python-colorspace
=================

A python 2/3 package mimiking the
[R colorspace](https://cran.r-project.org/package=colorspace) package.

I've just started developing the whole color-color-color framework,
might take some time get the package into a beta state. And even a bit
more to create proper testing routines.

However, feel free to get in touch with me if you are interested and/or
would like to start contributing to this project!

Alongside with the python package itself I also try to keep the
documentation up to date, however, might be a bit off-sync but
can be found at:

* [python-colorspace: on ReadTheDocs](https://python-colorspace.readthedocs.io)

Feel free to contact me via e-mail (Reto.Stauffer@uibk.ac.at).

Over and out,
R
