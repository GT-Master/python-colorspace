Logging and Environment Variables
=================================

The ``python-colorspace`` package uses ``logging``, default log level is ``WARNING``.
The logging level can be controlled by setting an environment variable called
``CSLOGLEVEL`` (e.g, on unix systems ``export CSLOGLEVEL=DEBUG``).
